    .
    3. Distribution Obligations.
    .
    3.1. Availability of Source Code.
    .
    Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make
    available in Executable form must also be made available in
    Source Code form and that Source Code form must be
    distributed only under the terms of this License. You must
    include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source
    Code form of the Covered Software You distribute or
    otherwise make available. You must inform recipients of any
    such Covered Software in Executable form as to how they can
    obtain such Covered Software in Source Code form in a
    reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used
    for software exchange.
    .
    3.2. Modifications.
    .
    The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute
    are governed by the terms of this License. You represent
    that You believe Your Modifications are Your original
    creation(s) and/or You have sufficient rights to grant the
    rights conveyed by this License.
    .
    3.3. Required Notices.
    .
    You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications that
    identifies You as the Contributor of the Modification. You
    may not remove or alter any copyright, patent or trademark
    notices contained within the Covered Software, or any
    notices of licensing or any descriptive text giving
    attribution to any Contributor or the Initial Developer.
    .
    3.4. Application of Additional Terms.
    .
    You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered
    Software in Source Code form that alters or restricts the
    applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights
    hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for,
    warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one
    or more recipients of Covered Software. However, you may do
    so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial
    Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely
    clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or
    liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby
    agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every
    Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial
    Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty,
    support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.
    .
    3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.
    .
    You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered
    Software under the terms of this License or under the terms
    of a license of Your choice, which may contain terms
    different from this License, provided that You are in
    compliance with the terms of this License and that the
    license for the Executable form does not attempt to limit or
    alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code form from
    the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the
    Covered Software in Executable form under a different
    license, You must make it absolutely clear that any terms
    which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not
    by the Initial Developer or Contributor. You hereby agree to
    indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for
    any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such
    Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.
    .
    3.6. Larger Works.
    .
    You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software
    with other code not governed by the terms of this License
    and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such
    a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License
    are fulfilled for the Covered Software. 
    .
    4. Versions of the License. 
    .
    4.1. New Versions.
    .
    Oracle Corp. is the initial license steward and may publish
    revised and/or new versions of this License from time to
    time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version
    number. Except as provided in Section 4.3, no one other than
    the license steward has the right to modify this License. 
    .
    4.2. Effect of New Versions.
    .
    You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make
    the Covered Software available under the terms of the
    version of the License under which You originally received
    the Covered Software. If the Initial Developer includes a
    notice in the Original Software prohibiting it from being
    distributed or otherwise made available under any subsequent
    version of the License, You must distribute and make the
    Covered Software available under the terms of the version of
    the License under which You originally received the Covered
    Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute
    or otherwise make the Covered Software available under the
    terms of any subsequent version of the License published by
    the license steward. 
    .
    4.3. Modified Versions.
    .
    When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a
    new license for Your Original Software, You may create and
    use a modified version of this License if You: (a) rename
    the license and remove any references to the name of the
    license steward (except to note that the license differs
    from this License); and (b) otherwise make it clear that the
    license contains terms which differ from this License.
    .
    5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.
    .
    COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS
    IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR
    IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE
    COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A
    PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO
    THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH
    YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY
    RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER
    CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING,
    REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY
    CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY
    COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS
    DISCLAIMER. 
    .
    6. TERMINATION. 
    .
    6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will
    terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms
    herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of
    becoming aware of the breach. Provisions which, by their
    nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this
    License shall survive.
    .
    6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding
    declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a
    Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against
    whom You assert such claim is referred to as "Participant")
    alleging that the Participant Software (meaning the
    Contributor Version where the Participant is a Contributor
    or the Original Software where the Participant is the
    Initial Developer) directly or indirectly infringes any
    patent, then any and all rights granted directly or
    indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer
    (if the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all
    Contributors under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License
    shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate
    prospectively and automatically at the expiration of such 60
    day notice period, unless if within such 60 day period You
    withdraw Your claim with respect to the Participant Software
    against such Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to
    a written agreement with Participant.
    .
    6.3. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2
    above, all end user licenses that have been validly granted
    by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination
    (excluding licenses granted to You by any distributor) shall
    survive termination.
    .
    7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.
    .
    UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER
    TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL
    YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY
    DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF
    SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT,
    SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY
    CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST
    PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE
    OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR
    LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE
    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
    SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY
    RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT
    APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS
    DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR
    CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY
    NOT APPLY TO YOU.
    .
    8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.
    .
    The Covered Software is a "commercial item," as that term is
    defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of
    "commercial computer software" (as that term is defined at
    48 C.F.R. 252.227-7014(a)(1)) and "commercial computer
    software documentation" as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R.
    12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48
    C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S.
    Government End Users acquire Covered Software with only
    those rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights
    clause is in lieu of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR,
    or other clause or provision that addresses Government
    rights in computer software under this License.
    .
    9. MISCELLANEOUS.
    .
    This License represents the complete agreement concerning
    subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is
    held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed
    only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This
    License shall be governed by the law of the jurisdiction
    specified in a notice contained within the Original Software
    (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides
    otherwise), excluding such jurisdiction's conflict-of-law
    provisions. Any litigation relating to this License shall be
    subject to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the
    jurisdiction and venue specified in a notice contained
    within the Original Software, with the losing party
    responsible for costs, including, without limitation, court
    costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The
    application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts
    for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.
    Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a
    contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not
    apply to this License. You agree that You alone are
    responsible for compliance with the United States export
    administration regulations (and the export control laws and
    regulation of any other countries) when You use, distribute
    or otherwise make available any Covered Software.
    .
    10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.
    .
    As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each
    party is responsible for claims and damages arising,
    directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights
    under this License and You agree to work with Initial
    Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility
    on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall
    be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.

 notifies LibRaw in writing of such Claim, LibRaw has sole control over
 the defense of the Claim and/or any settlement negotiations, and

 party infringement Claims.

 License as from the date of service of such notice whenever any of the
 following events occurs:

         assignment for the benefit of creditors; (v) if a petition
         under any foreign, state, or United States bankruptcy act,
         receivership statute, or the like, as they now exist, or as
         they may be amended, is filed by Licensee; or (vi) if such
         petition is filed by any third party, or an application for a
         receiver is made by anyone against Licensee and such petition
         or application is not resolved favorably within ninety (90)
         days.
 (c) Consequences and Obligations of Revocation.
 If this License is revoked for any reason, then Licensee's rights under

 Modifying of the Software and any Derivative Work, and further to

 Work in Licensee’s possession or under its Control. The obligations of
 this Section shall expressly survive the revocation of this or any
 other related agreement.

 7. CONFIDENTIALITY.
 (a) General.
 Either Party or its employees or agents may, in the course of
 performing their responsibilities under this License, be exposed to or
 acquire information, which is proprietary or confidential to the other
 Party or to third parties to whom that other Party owes a duty of
 confidentiality. Any and all non-public information of any form
 obtained by a Party or its employees or agents while performing this
 License shall be deemed to be confidential and proprietary information.
 The receiving Party shall hold such information in strict confidence
 and not copy, record, reproduce (using any medium), sell, assign,
 license,market, transfer or otherwise dispose of, give or disclose such
 information to third parties (except to third parties who are bound to
 the receiving Party by a like obligation of confidentiality and who

 License) or use such information for any purposes whatsoever other than
 in the performance of this License and will advise each of its
 employees and agents who may be exposed to such proprietary and
 confidential information of their obligations to keep such information
 confidential. Licensee acknowledges and agrees that any breach of this
 Section 7 will constitute a material breach of the License entitling
 LibRaw to terminate this License under Section 6(b) herein. The
 obligations of this Section shall expressly survive the revocation of
 this or any other related agreement.
 (b) Exceptions.
 For the avoidance of doubt, proprietary and confidential information
 shall not include information which is (i) in or becomes part of the
 public domain other than by disclosure by the receiving Party in
 violation of this License; (ii) demonstrably known to the receiving
 Party previously, (iii) independently developed by the receiving Party
 outside of this License, or (iv) rightfully obtained by the receiving
 Party from third parties. This provision shall expressly survive
 termination of this License

 LICENSEE SUBLICENSEE.
 (b) The License herein granted by LibRaw to Licensee shall include the
     right to use the trademarks and/or service marks of LibRaw
     (collectively, the "Marks"); provided, however, that Licensee shall
     be entitled to use such Marks only in connection with the marketing
     of the Software and Licensee shall make no other use of the Marks.
     Subject to the license rights herein granted by LibRaw to Licensee
     to use such Marks in connection with the marketing of the Software
     hereunder, the Marks are and shall remain the sole and exclusive
     property of LibRaw. Upon the termination of this License, Licensee
     shall cease all use of the Marks. Licensee shall not at any time

     to the Software or any portion thereof. Licensee recognizes that
     all or a part of the Software may be copyrighted, trademarked or
     patented by LibRaw and agrees that any such act shall not cause or
     be construed as causing the Software or any portion thereof to be
     in the public domain. Licensee agrees that it will not remove from
     copies of the Software, or any component thereof, any form of
     copyright or other proprietary notice appearing on the Software or

 duties hereunder without the prior written consent of Licensor.

 delegation will be null, void and of no effect.
 (c) Waiver.
 No waiver under this License will be valid or binding unless set forth
 in writing and duly executed by the Party against whom enforcement of
 such waiver is sought. Any such waiver will constitute a waiver only
 with respect to the specific matter described therein and will in no
 way impair the rights of the Party granting such waiver in any other
 respect orat any other time. Any delay or forbearance by either Party
 in exercising any right hereunder will not be deemed a waiver of that
 right.

 This License shall be governed and construed in accordance with the
 laws of the State of Maryland without regard to the conflicts of laws
 or principles thereof. Any Claim related to this License or between the
 Parties must be brought exclusively in the Circuit Court sitting in
 Montgomery County, Maryland or the U.S. District Court for the District
 of Maryland, and the Parties irrevocably submit and consent to such
 jurisdiction and venue and waive any right they may have to seek any
 change of jurisdiction or venue. The obligations of this Section shall
 expressly survive the revocation of this or any other related
 agreement.
 (e) Counterparts.
 This License may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of
 which when so executed will be deemed to be an original and all of
 which when taken together will constitute one agreement.
 (f) Headings; Interpretation.

 convenience and will not affect the meaning or interpretation of this
 License. This License will be construed fairly according to its terms,
 without regard to the identity of the drafter of any provision in this
 License.
 (g) Entire Agreement.

 the Parties as to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior
 discussions between the Parties, and neither Party shall be bound by
 any conditions, definitions, warranties, understandings or
 representations with respect to such subject matter other than as
 expressly provided herein. This License may not be modified or amended
 or supplemented except in writing executed by the duly authorized
 representatives of both Parties. If any provision of this License is
 declared to be invalid or unenforceable, such invalid or unenforceable
 provision, shall be deemed struck from this License, but only in the
 jurisdiction in which such provision was declared invalid or
 unenforceable, and the enforceability of the remaining provisions of
 this License shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby. This
 License shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties
 hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns, and shall
 not confer any rights or remedies upon any Person not a party hereto.
 The obligations of this Section shall expressly survive the revocation
 of this or any other related agreement.
 (h) Construction.

 “shrink-wrap” license including in any package, media or electronic
 version of the Software and any such Software will be licensed solely
 under the terms of this License. When executed and dated by both
 Parties, any order forms that reference this License and its Effective
 Date will be incorporated in this License by reference.

 include the plural and vice-versa, and words of any gender will be
 deemed to include all genders.

 THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE
 COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY
 COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS
 AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.
 .
 BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO
 BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. TO THE EXTENT THIS LICENSE MAY BE
 CONSIDERED TO BE A CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED
 HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

    artistic work, or phonogram or performance and includes cinematographic
    adaptations or any other form in which the Work may be recast,
    transformed, or adapted including in any form recognizably derived from
    the original, except that a work that constitutes a Collection will not
    be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License. For the
    avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical work, performance or
    phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a
    moving image ("synching") will be considered an Adaptation for the
    purpose of this License.
    "Collection" means a collection of literary or artistic works, such as
    encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or
    broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other than works listed in
    Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of the selection and arrangement of
    their contents, constitute intellectual creations, in which the Work is
    included in its entirety in unmodified form along with one or more other
    contributions, each constituting separate and independent works in
    themselves, which together are assembled into a collective whole. A work
    that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation (as
    defined below) for the purposes of this License.
    "Creative Commons Compatible License" means a license that is listed at
    http://creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses that has been approved by
    Creative Commons as being essentially equivalent to this License,

    have the same purpose, meaning and effect as the License Elements of
    this License; and, (ii) explicitly permits the relicensing of
    adaptations of works made available under that license under this
    License or a Creative Commons jurisdiction license with the same License
    Elements as this License.
    "Distribute" means to make available to the public the original and

    organization that transmits the broadcast.
    "Work" means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the terms
    of this License including without limitation any production in the
    literary, scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be the mode or
    form of its expression including digital form, such as a book, pamphlet
    and other writing; a lecture, address, sermon or other work of the same
    nature; a dramatic or dramatico-musical work; a choreographic work or
    entertainment in dumb show; a musical composition with or without words;
    a cinematographic work to which are assimilated works expressed by a
    process analogous to cinematography; a work of drawing, painting,
    architecture, sculpture, engraving or lithography; a photographic work
    to which are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to
    photography; a work of applied art; an illustration, map, plan, sketch
    or three-dimensional work relative to geography, topography,
    architecture or science; a performance; a broadcast; a phonogram; a
    compilation of data to the extent it is protected as a copyrightable
    work; or a work performed by a variety or circus performer to the extent
    it is not otherwise considered a literary or artistic work.
    "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License
    who has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect
    to the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to
    exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.

    to communicate to the public those public recitations, by any means or
    process, including by wire or wireless means or public digital

    members of the public may access these Works from a place and at a place

 2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce,
 limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from
 limitations or exceptions that are provided for in connection with the
 copyright protection under copyright law or other applicable laws.
 .
 3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,
 Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,
 perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to
 exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:
 .
    to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more
    Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the
    Collections;
    to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation,
    including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to
    clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to
    the original Work. For example, a translation could be marked "The
    original work was translated from English to Spanish," or a modification
    could indicate "The original work has been modified.";
    to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in
    Collections; and,
    to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.
 .
    For the avoidance of doubt:
	Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in
	which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or
	compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves
	the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by
	You of the rights granted under this License;
	Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which
	the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory
	licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the exclusive
	right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the
	rights granted under this License; and,
	Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect
	royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor
	is a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary
	licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the
	rights granted under this License.
 .
 The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now
 known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such
 modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other
 media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly
 granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.
 .
 4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made
 subject to and limited by the following restrictions:
 .
    You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of
    this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource
    Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You
    Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on
    the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the
    recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient
    under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You
    must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the
    disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or
    Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You
    may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that
    restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the
    rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This
    Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but
    this does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be
    made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection,
    upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable,
    remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(c), as
    requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor
    You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any
    credit as required by Section 4(c), as requested.
    You may Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation only under the
    terms of: (i) this License; (ii) a later version of this License with
    the same License Elements as this License; (iii) a Creative Commons
    jurisdiction license (either this or a later license version) that
    contains the same License Elements as this License (e.g.,
    Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 US)); (iv) a Creative Commons Compatible
    License. If you license the Adaptation under one of the licenses
    mentioned in (iv), you must comply with the terms of that license. If
    you license the Adaptation under the terms of any of the licenses
    mentioned in (i), (ii) or (iii) (the "Applicable License"), you must
    comply with the terms of the Applicable License generally and the
    following provisions: (I) You must include a copy of, or the URI for,
    the Applicable License with every copy of each Adaptation You Distribute
    or Publicly Perform; (II) You may not offer or impose any terms on the
    Adaptation that restrict the terms of the Applicable License or the
    ability of the recipient of the Adaptation to exercise the rights
    granted to that recipient under the terms of the Applicable License;
    (III) You must keep intact all notices that refer to the Applicable
    License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work
    as included in the Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform; (IV)
    when You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Adaptation, You may not
    impose any effective technological measures on the Adaptation that
    restrict the ability of a recipient of the Adaptation from You to
    exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the
    Applicable License. This Section 4(b) applies to the Adaptation as
    incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection
    apart from the Adaptation itself to be made subject to the terms of the
    Applicable License.
    If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or
    Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to
    Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and
    provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the
    name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied,
    and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or
    parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for
    attribution ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice,
    terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or
    parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent
    reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be
    associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the
    copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and (iv) ,
    consistent with Ssection 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit
    identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., "French
    translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on
    original Work by Original Author"). The credit required by this Section
    4(c) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however,
    that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit
    will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation
    or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at
    least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors.
    For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this
    Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and,
    by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or
    explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or
    endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties,
    as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate,
    express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or
    Attribution Parties.
    Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be
    otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or
    Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations
    or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other
    derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to
    the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those
    jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted
    in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be
    deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory
    action prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the
    Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the
    fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You
    to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License
    (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.
 .
 5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
 .
 UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR
 OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY
 KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE,
 INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY,
 FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT
 OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER
 OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF
 IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
 .
 6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE
 LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY
 SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING
 OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN
 ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
 .
 7. Termination
 .
    This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
    automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.
    Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections
    from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses
    terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full
    compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will
    survive any termination of this License.
    Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is
    perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).
    Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the
    Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at
    any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to
    withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is
    required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this
    License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as
    stated above.
 .
 8. Miscellaneous
 .
    Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection,
    the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same
    terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
    Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor
    offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms
    and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
    If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under
    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
    the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action
    by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to
    the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and
    enforceable.
    No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no
    breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing
    and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.
    This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with
    respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings,
    agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified
    here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may
    appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified
    without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.
    The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this
    License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention
    for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on
    September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright
    Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and
    the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These
    rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in
    which the License terms are sought to be enforced according to the
    corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty
    provisions in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of
    rights granted under applicable copyright law includes additional rights
    not granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be
    included in the License; this License is not intended to restrict the
    license of any rights under applicable law.
